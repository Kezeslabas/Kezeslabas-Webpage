Script;Automatic Mining Platform by Kezeslabas;content/thumb/auto_mining_platform.jpg;This is a script that I made for my personal use. I decided to polish and upload it, because I thought that someone else could find it useful as well. The script uses Pistons, Drills and a Rotor to reach and mine out as many Stone/Ore as possible with that setup.;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1695500366;

Script;Antenna Message Sender & Receiver by Kezeslabas;content/thumb/antenna_message_sender&receiver.png;This is the redesign of an older script I made, to support the progression transmitting feature of my Automatic Mining Platform Script. This script is capable of both sending and receiving messages from remote grids, by using programmable blocks. Based on the message that it receivs, it can eiter write it out to an LCD screen (even to cockpits), or it can trigger/start a timer block. The handling of the blocks is dynamic, so any number of blocks can be connected to this script. An antenna is reqired in both the sending of receiving end of the script.;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1705183500;
